# My dotfiles
A place to save / share all my dotfiles. For now it's only [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

## Neovim
The config is a simplified version of the combination of two popular `vimrc` files: one from [@amix](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and another from [@rafi](https://github.com/rafi/vim-config).

## Fish
Fish shell setup using [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) and some other simple functions.
